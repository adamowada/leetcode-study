# [76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/description/)

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        """
        Finds the minimum window substring in 's' that contains all characters from 't' (including duplicates).
        
        Parameters:
            s (str): The string to search within.
            t (str): The target string containing characters to include in the window.
        
        Returns:
            str: The smallest substring of 's' that contains every character in 't', or an empty string

**Summary of Techniques and Approaches:**

- **Sliding Window Technique:** The solution dynamically adjusts the window boundaries with two pointers (left and right) to identify valid substrings efficiently.
  
- **Two-Pointer Strategy:** By expanding the window with the right pointer and contracting it with the left pointer once requirements are met, the method minimizes unnecessary iterations for optimal performance.

- **Hash Map for Frequency Counting:** Using a dictionary (or Counter) to record the frequency of characters enables constant-time checks on whether the current window satisfies the frequency requirements of t.

- **Incremental Validation:** The variable `formed` is used to keep track of when the current window meets all necessary conditions, reducing redundant checks and ensuring only valid windows are considered for minimization.

- **General Applicability:** These techniques can be applied to other problems involving dynamic window resizing, such as substring search, array partitioning, or pattern matching challenges. Identify when a problem asks for finding the smallest/largest subarray or substring with specific properties, and consider leveraging the sliding window approach for an efficient and elegant solution.
