# [242. Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/)

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        """
        Determine if string 't' is an anagram of string 's' by comparing character frequencies.

        Parameters:
            s (str): The first string to compare.
            t (str): The second string, which is to be checked as an anagram of 's'.

        Returns:
            bool: True if 't' is an anagram of 's', otherwise False.
        """
        # If lengths are not equal, 't' cannot be an anagram of 's'
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False

        # Create frequency counters for both strings using Counter (efficient for Unicode as well)
        # freq_s counts occurrences of each character in s
        freq_s = Counter(s)
        # freq_t counts occurrences of each character in t
        freq_t = Counter(t)

        # Compare the two frequency dictionaries; anagrams have identical counts for every character
        return freq_s == freq_t
```

**Summary of Techniques and Approaches:**

- **Hashing with Frequency Counters:** By utilizing `collections.Counter`, the solution creates hash maps to count character occurrences. This approach is efficient (O(n)) and directly applicable for problems that require frequency comparisons or counting elements.

- **Early Termination by Length Check:** The solution first checks if the lengths of the two strings are equal, an effective initial filter to avoid unnecessary computations. This technique is useful in many string-related problems where mismatched sizes immediately disqualify a valid solution.

- **Adaptability for Unicode:** The use of `Counter` handles Unicode characters seamlessly without additional modifications. This makes the approach broadly applicable when the input might extend beyond simple lowercase English letters.

- **General Problem-Solving Tip:** Look for ways to reduce problem constraints (like eliminating non-candidate comparisons) and use built-in data structures to simplify logic. When faced with problems involving comparisons of element counts, consider using hash maps or frequency counters to deliver clear and efficient solutions.
