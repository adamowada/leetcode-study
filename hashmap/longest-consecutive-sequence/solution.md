**Summary of Techniques and Approaches:**

- **Set-Based Lookup:** Utilizing a set for O(1) average time complexity when checking for existence of elements is key. This technique is widely applicable in problems requiring fast membership testing.

- **Sequence Start Identification:** The condition `if num - 1 not in num_set` ensures that each sequence is only counted once from its starting point. This minimizes redundant computations and guarantees O(n) time complexity.

- **Single Pass Expansion:** For each potential sequence start, the solution expands the consecutive sequence in a while loop until it no longer exists. This strategy of expanding from a seed element can be applied to various problems that involve contiguous or relational data spread across a collection.

- **General Application:** Recognize scenarios where similar set-based approaches can avoid unnecessary iterations, such as finding unique elements, deduplication, or solving connected component problems. This method is particularly useful when the order of elements doesn't matter or can be rearranged for efficiency.
