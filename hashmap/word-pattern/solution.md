# [290. Word Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern/description/)

```python
class Solution:
    def wordPattern(self, pattern: str, s: str) -> bool:
        """
        Check if a string 's' follows the same bijective word pattern as given in 'pattern'.
        
        Parameters:
            pattern (str): A string representing the pattern where each character corresponds to a unique word.
            s (str): A string containing words separated by a single space.
        
        Returns:
            bool: True if 's' follows the same bijective pattern as 'pattern', False otherwise.
        """

**Summary of Techniques and Approaches:**

- **Dictionary-Based Mapping:** This solution utilizes two dictionaries for creating bi-directional mappings between pattern characters and words. This approach is efficient when ensuring bijections or unique correspondences, which is commonly applicable in problems requiring mapping between two sets of elements.

- **Input Validation:** By checking if the pattern length matches the number of words early on, we quickly handle invalid cases. This is a common defensive programming technique that helps reduce unnecessary computation.

- **Iterative Validation:** The solution iterates over both the pattern and the list of words simultaneously using the zip function. This pattern is versatile and can be used in many problems that require parallel iteration and immediate consistency checks.

- **Clear, Modular Code:** Including inline comments and a descriptive docstring aids in understanding the solution. Maintaining clarity in code is critical for reusability and for adapting similar approaches to other problems where mapping or one-to-one relationships are involved.
