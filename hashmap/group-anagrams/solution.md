# [49. Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/description/)

```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        """
        Groups an array of strings into lists of anagrams.

**Summary of Techniques and Approaches:**

- **Hashing with Sorted Keys:** The solution sorts each string and uses it as a tuple key in a dictionary. This method is applicable to grouping or matching problems where the order of characters (or elements) is irrelevant.
  
- **Dictionary for Aggregation:** Using a dictionary to store and group similar items is a common approach in data processing tasks, especially where grouping by a computed key is needed.
  
- **Time Complexity Consideration:** Although sorting each string introduces extra computation, this approach remains efficient given the problem constraints and guarantees that anagrams yield the same key.

- **General Applicability:** These techniques can be employed in various problems that require grouping or classifying items. Look for problems where you can transform elements into a standardized form (such as sorting or normalization) to easily compare them.
