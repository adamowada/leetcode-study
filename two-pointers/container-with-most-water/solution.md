# [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        Calculate the maximum area of water that can be contained by two vertical lines.

        Returns:
            int: The maximum area of water that the container can store.

**Summary of Techniques and Approaches:**

- **Two-Pointer Technique:** By initializing pointers at both ends and moving the pointer at the shorter line inward, the algorithm efficiently explores the solution space in linear time. This approach reduces the problem's time complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n).

- **Greedy Strategy:** The choice of moving the pointer at the smaller height is a greedy decision aimed at increasing the potential area in future iterations.

- **In-Place Calculation:** No extra space is used aside from a few variables, making it both space efficient and easy to understand.

**General Tips:**

- Use the two-pointer technique in array problems where the solution involves finding pairs that optimize a condition, especially when the array is sorted or can be processed from both ends.
- Identify the limiting factor in the problem (like the shorter vertical line in this problem) to decide which pointer to move.
- Focus on in-place modifications and greedy decisions to reduce unnecessary computations and optimize the overall efficiency of your solution.
