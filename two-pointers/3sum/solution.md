**Summary of Techniques and Approaches:**

- **Sorting:** Sorting the array upfront allows for an organized approach to identify candidate triplets and simplifies the duplicate handling process.
- **Two-Pointer Technique:** By fixing one element and using two pointers for the other elements, the solution efficiently finds pairs that meet the target condition with a time complexity of O(nÂ²).
- **Skip Duplicates:** Careful management of duplicate values prevents the inclusion of redundant triplets, ensuring the result set contains unique combinations.
- **Single Pass over Remaining Elements:** Once the list is sorted, iterating with two pointers in a single pass for each fixed element optimizes the search process.

These techniques are broadly applicable to problems that require finding subsets of elements that satisfy a specific condition, particularly when the input can be sorted to leverage ordering properties, enabling efficient duplicate handling and the two-pointer strategy.
