**Summary of Techniques and Approaches:**

- **Stack-Based Evaluation:** The core idea uses a stack to store operands and perform operations when encountering an operator. This technique is invaluable for evaluating Reverse Polish Notation and can also be used for syntax parsing, expression evaluation, and backtracking problems.

- **Token Parsing and Conditional Branching:** The solution iterates through a list of tokens and uses conditional logic to differentiate between numbers and operators. This approach is widely applicable in problems where input must be parsed and processed based on type or content, such as interpreters or custom parsers.

- **Handling Edge Cases in Arithmetic Operations:** For division, special care is taken to handle truncation toward zero. This is an example of attention to problem constraints, ensuring that computed results meet given specifications. This careful constraint handling is applicable in any problem where exact arithmetic or rounding rules are specified.

- **Single-Pass Evaluation:** The solution processes the expression in one pass, optimizing both time and space complexity. Recognizing opportunities to solve problems in a single pass is a powerful technique that enhances performance in a variety of algorithmic challenges.

These general techniques can be applied across multiple domains: use stacks for problems with nested structures or reverse processing, branch conditionally when different token types or cases are encountered, and always consider edge cases related to arithmetic operations or input constraints.
