**Summary of Techniques and Approaches:**

- **Stack Utilization for Nested Expressions:** A stack is used to store the previous result and sign when a parenthesis is encountered. This method allows handling nested or recursive expressions by preserving the context before diving into the inner expression.

- **Single-Pass Iteration:** The solution processes the input string in a single pass, ensuring linear time complexity. It accumulates digits to form numbers, applies the current sign, and resets variables appropriately.

- **In-Place Sign and Number Accumulation:** By maintaining a current number and sign that are updated as the string is traversed, we efficiently handle arithmetic operations and seamlessly integrate them into the result without extra passes.

- **General Applicability:** These techniques can be applied to various problems involving expression evaluation, nested structures, and in-place modifications of data. Identifying opportunities to use a stack for tracking previous states is key when dealing with nested or recursive data patterns.
