**Summary of Techniques and Approaches:**

- **KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) Algorithm:**  
  This solution implements the KMP pattern matching algorithm to achieve O(n + m) time complexity, where n is the length of haystack and m is the length of needle. It avoids redundant rechecks by leveraging information from the LPS (longest prefix suffix) array.

- **Preprocessing with LPS Array:**  
  The LPS array is computed for the needle to determine the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix. This array is then used to skip unnecessary comparisons during the search phase, a technique that can be applied to other pattern matching and string searching problems.

- **Two-Phase Approach (Preprocessing and Searching):**  
  The solution is divided into two clear phases: preprocessing to build the LPS array and then searching for the needle in the haystack. This division is useful for breaking down complex problems into manageable sub-problems.

- **General Application:**  
  These techniques are applicable whenever an optimal in-place search or pattern matching is required. When encountering string search problems or scenarios that involve searching within a sequence while minimizing time complexity, consider using or adapting KMP or similar preprocessing strategies.

- **Tips:**  
  - Look for repeating patterns or overlapping sub-problems that can be precomputed.
  - When a straightforward comparison leads to repetitive work, consider algorithms that exploit previous computations.
  - Always analyze the time complexityâ€”optimizing from O(n*m) to O(n + m) can be critical in scaling with input size.
