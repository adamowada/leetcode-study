**Summary of Techniques and Approaches:**

- **Mapping with a Dictionary:** A dictionary (`numeral_map`) efficiently stores the fixed association between roman numeral characters and integer values. This approach is broadly applicable when a set of inputs maps directly to a set of outputs.

- **Linear Scan with Lookahead:** The solution iterates through the input string once (O(n) time complexity). The use of a lookahead (comparing with the next character) allows handling special subtractive cases elegantly. This technique of scanning with lookahead can be applied to pattern matching and parsing tasks.

- **Conditional Subtraction and Addition:** By checking if the current numeral is less than the next one, the solution determines whether to subtract or add the numeralâ€™s value. This conditional logic is a powerful approach for handling exceptions within sequences and can be applied in scenarios with conditional adjustments.

- **In-Place Computation:** The approach computes the result with constant extra space, demonstrating efficient in-place computation techniques which are useful when memory is limited.

These techniques are useful when solving problems that involve converting between representations, scanning sequences for patterns, and performing conditional operations during one-pass iterations.
