# [274. H-Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/description/)

```python
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        Calculate the h-index from a list of citation counts.
        
        The h-index is defined as the maximum value h such that the researcher has published
        at least h papers with each having at least h citations.
        
        Parameters:
            citations (List[int]): A list where each element represents the citation count for a paper.
        
        Returns:
            int: The h-index for the given citation counts.
        """
        # First, sort the citation counts in ascending order.
        citations.sort()
        n = len(citations)  # Total number of papers.
        
        # Iterate over the sorted citations list. 
        # The idea is to find the smallest index i such that the (n - i) papers have at least (n - i) citations.
        for i in range(n):
            h = n - i  # h is the number of papers with citation counts >= current paper's count.
            # Check if the current paper's citation count is at least h.
            if citations[i] >= h:
                return h  # This is the h-index.

**Summary of Techniques and Approaches:**

- **Sorting Approach:** Sorting the citations simplifies the problem by lining up the papers so that we can calculate the number of papers with citations above a threshold with a simple index arithmetic.
  
- **Single Pass Post-Sort:** By iterating over the sorted list, we determine the candidate h-index in one pass, making the solution efficient with a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting and O(n) for the iteration. 

- **Problem Breakdown:** The problem is decomposed into sorting and then checking a condition with a transformed index (n - i). This technique is applicable to other problems where the order of elements is critical and you need a threshold-based decision.

- **General Tips:** 
  - Use sorting to simplify range checks.
  - Leverage index arithmetic to efficiently compute counts relative to a threshold.
  - Always think about converting the problem into a simpler form via transformation (e.g., sorting) for an optimal solution.
